# planets
A JavaScript orrery

This project is intended to be an accurate and pretty toy solar system.

[Play with it](https://a-j-douglass.github.io/planets/)

It shows the solar system from below,  scaled such that earth is up (12 o clock) at new years day each year and moves clockwise.

So it's like a clock, with earth in blue as the 'year hand'.

If you don't want to wait long enough for the outer planets to move, drag them around and the date will update.

To build you need node and npm

`$>npm install; gulp;`

Tested on Windows and OSX
